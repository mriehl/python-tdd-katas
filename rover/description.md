Mars Rover Kata
==================

*Source* : http://dallashackclub.com/rover with modifications

Develop an api that moves a rover around on a grid.

[ ] You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover 
    and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.

[ ] Implement an API that moves the rover forward/backward (f,b).

[ ] Implement an API that turns the rover left/right (l,r).

[ ] The rover should accept a character array of 
    commands and perform them in order

[ ] Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another 
    (planets are spheres after all)

[ ] Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. 
    If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, 
    the rover moves up to the last possible point and 
    reports the obstacle.
